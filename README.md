## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Research Assistant | Genomic Data Analyst** @ [Kim Lab, University of Pennsylvania](https://kim.bio.upenn.edu/) _(Aug 2019 - Present)_ <br>
**Advisor :** [Dr. Junhyong Kim](https://www.bio.upenn.edu/people/junhyong-kim)
- **_Phylogeny Project:_** 
    - Adopted and Evaluated over 50 genomic lineage tree construction algorithms to single-cell RNAseq data.
    - Developed a statistical learning algorithm to construct a lineage tree based on single-cell RNAseq data.
    - Proposed linear programming algorithm for feature engineering to improve the model’s performance.

- **_Simulation Project:_** 
    - Developed a simulation program to generate Single-cell RNAseq data with reliable lineage annotation.
    - Implemented metrics-based unsupervised learning to exam the simulation quality.
    - Design an R Shiny Application for usability and visualization of the algorithm.

<br>

**Research Assistant** @ [Center for Energy & Environmental Policy Research](http://ceep.bit.edu.cn/english/) _(Sep 2012 - Jun 2016)_ <br>
- **_The influence of climate change on CO2 emissions:_** 
    - Evaluated climate change by Heating-degree-day and Cooling-degree-day indices.
    - Analyzed the influence of carbon emission by econometric panel data model with population density, industrial structure, urbanization rate, per capita income.
    - Published a paper featured in the Journal of Cleaner Production.

- **_Energy consumption and economic growth in China:_** 
    - Divided China into four districts via the vector autoregression model.
    - Performed a multivariate causality framework of the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in China using Markov chain and Granger causality test.
    - Proved the causal relations among the four districts (one-way, two-way, short-term, long-term).
    - Published a paper on Sustainable Energy and Environmental Protection
