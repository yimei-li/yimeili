**Research Assistant** @ [Center for Energy & Environmental Policy Research](http://ceep.bit.edu.cn/english/) _(Sep 2012 - Jun 2016)_ <br>
- **_The influence of climate change on CO2 emissions:_** 
    - Evaluated climate change by Heating-degree-day and Cooling-degree-day indices.
    - Analyzed the influence of carbon emission by econometric panel data model with population density, industrial structure, urbanization rate, per capita income.
